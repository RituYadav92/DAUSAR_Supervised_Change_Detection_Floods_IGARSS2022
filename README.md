## Attentive Dual Stream Siamese U-Net for Flood Detection on Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Data (IGARSS July 2022)

## Description
Due to climate and land-use change, natural disasters such as flooding have been increasing in recent years. Timely and reliable flood detection and mapping can help emergency response and disaster management. In this work, we propose a flood detection network using bi-temporal SAR acquisitions. The proposed segmentation network has an encoder-decoder architecture with two Siamese encoders for pre and post-flood images. The network's feature maps are fused and enhanced using attention blocks to achieve more accurate detection of the flooded areas. Our proposed network is evaluated on publicly available Sen1Flood11 [1] benchmark dataset. The network outperformed the existing state-of-the-art (uni-temporal) flood detection method by 6% IOU. The experiments highlight that the combination of bi-temporal SAR data with an effective network architecture achieves more accurate flood detection than uni-temporal methods.
